================

Creating a script that will convert a music archive from lossless (or nearly lossless) to lossy formats.  When completed this script will have the ability to check a folder of originals, compare the timestamp and conver if necessary.  The master file directory structure should be preserved.

This is my first time coding in python and my first project on GitHub.
